Data file 'comb_u_pred-causal-eb.pkl' here is achieved based on the causal PINNs with transfer learning [https://github.com/taniyakapoor/Causal-PINN-for-beam/tree/second].

Euler Bernoulli beam dynamic is successfully resolved by our newly developed SA-PINNs-TDD using 1 partition, 
which previous studies [Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 133 (2024) 108085] failed to accomplish with their proposed SA-PINNs.

Furthermore, our approach achieves significantly higher accuracy-exceeding that of the causal PINNs with transfer learning by 58 times, as shown in the Table.
