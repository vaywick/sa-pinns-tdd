Euler Bernoulli beam dynamic is successfully resolved by our newly developed SA-PINNs (SA-PINNs-TDD with one subdomain), 
which previous studies [Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 133 (2024) 108085] failed to accomplish.
Furthermore, our approach achieves significantly higher accuracy-exceeding that of the causal PINNs with transfer learning by 58 times.
