The causal-data folder, containing two .pkl files, was produced based on causal PINNs with transfer learning [https://github.com/taniyakapoor/Causal-PINN-for-beam/tree/second].

Timoshenko beam dynamic is successfully resolved by our newly developed SA-PINNs-TDD using 1 partition, 
which previous studies [Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 133 (2024) 108085] failed to accomplish with their proposed SA-PINNs.

Furthermore, our approach achieves significantly higher accuracy-exceeding that of the causal PINNs with transfer learning by 20 times, as shown in the Table.

The rl2-compute.py file computes the relative L2-norm error using the same formula for both our proposed model and the causal PINNs model with transfer learning.
