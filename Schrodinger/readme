First-order rogue wave solution of the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation is accurately solved using the SA-PINNs-TDD model.
High-precision predictions are achieved with training over 5 or 7 subdomains, whereas the single-subdomain training approach-equivalent to the original SA-PINNs model-fails to attain comparable accuracy.
